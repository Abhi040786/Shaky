Handle input with Mac, Unix, or Windows line delimiters (CR, LF, or CRLF),
when running on any of the 3 platforms.

Print out details of the calculation of PTI, DEPI, etc. for easier auditing.

Clean up variable names (Exner's not very consistent with his abbreviations,
but he's better than I've been).

More input validation (sanity-check columns against each other).

Prettier output format (PDF? RTF? HTML?).
